          <p>
            Type (or copy/paste) the HEX code in the input box on the left hand
            side. The code can be with or without the hashtag.
          </p>
          <p>
            The website will then generate the closest Tailwind color on the
            right hand side, together with the corresponding HEX code. We use
            the Delta E algorithm, which is the official way to measure the
            difference between two colors.
          </p>
          <p>
            You can quickly copy either of the two generated color codes by
            clicking or tapping on the clipboard icon, or by pressing the Space
            or Enter keys when focused on the icon. And you can compare the two
            colors visually.
          </p>
          <p>
            We also highlight whether the difference between the HEX code input
            and the generated Tailwind color is visible to the human eye. We do
            this by checking whether the Delta E score is higher than 1, which
            is the official way to establish this fact.

            Hi there! My name is Mihail and I'm a software engineer based in
            London, UK. I was initially sceptical of Tailwind, but I decided to
            give it a go last year and never looked back.
          </p>
          <p>
            I often check out other websites for design inspiration, especially
            around colour themes. But not everyone uses Tailwind; in those
            instances, I have to figure out a way to fetch it from the HEX code
            found in the CSS. Hence why I decided to build this website :)
          </p>

            I'm using the <Link url="https://astro.build/">Astro</Link> and <Link

            > frameworks for the website, and it's hosted on <Link
              url="https://pages.cloudflare.com/">Cloudflare Pages</Link
